# KMeans-Clustering-Unsupervised-ML-Projects
Here are the ML projects for Unsupervised Learning using k-means clustering algorithm. [ k-means clustering:  is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.]

# K-means

This is third assignment of Introduction to Machine Learning (COMP 462) course. In this assignment, I implement  K-means clustering algorithm to cluster given three different datasets.

## Datasets
The dataset ﬁles contain features (in 2D) and class labels. In this assignment, I
didn’t use class labels since K-means is an unsupervised algorithm and does not
need class labels. Scatter plot of the datasets given in Figure 1.

## K-means Algorithm
K-means clustering is a simple and popular type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which is used on unlabeled data. 
The goal of this algorithm is toﬁnd groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable
*K*. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of *K* groups according to provided features similarity.
Algorithm steps for K-means given as following.

1. Randomly pick *K* observations and set them as initial cluster centers
2. Iterate until cluster assignments stop changing: 
    * For each of the *K* clusters, compute the cluster centroid. The *k*th clustercentroid is the vector of the p feature means for the observations in the *k*th cluster.
    * Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest (where closest
is deﬁned using Euclidean distance).

When N is number of samples and K is number of clusters, K-means algorithm try to minimize objective function which given as following.

## Clustering Results
I implement K-Means class for algorithm and cluster three given dataset with
following conﬁgurations:
* Dataset1: k=3, k=7
* Dataset2: k=2, k=5
* Dataset3: k=3, k=8

Clustering results for each conﬁguration given as follows.
