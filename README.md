# KMeans-Clustering-Unsupervised-ML-Projects
Here are the ML projects for Unsupervised Learning using k-means clustering algorithm. [ k-means clustering:  is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.]
